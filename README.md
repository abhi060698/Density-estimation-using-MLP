# Density-estimation-using-MLP
Map the cumulative distribution of a dataset, and use it for survival analysis.
The ANN.py file contains the MLP generator, which i have used to generate the network used in this project.
The CDF.py contains the class CDF, which contains the function to generate and plot the CDF and PDF.
The .csv files contain the test and training data used in this project. 
*The code is based off of the research paper, Neural Networks for Density Estimation, by Amir Aitya and Malik Magdon-Ismail, from the California Institute of Technology*
